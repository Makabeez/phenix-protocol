# AshGuard Protocol - Agent Skill File (v1.7.0)

## Product Thinking & Strategy
- **Problem Statement**: Millions in Solana assets risk being lost forever due to wallet dormancy or lost access, with no decentralized inheritance solution.
- **Technical Approach**: Persistent AI monitoring via VPS, using Solana Agent Kit for dormancy detection and Jupiter for secure asset rescue.
- **Target Audience**: Long-term SOL holders, stakers, and DeFi users needing an autonomous safety net.
- **Business Model**: Fee-based model on successful rescue executions and premium monitoring tiers.
- **Competitive Landscape**: Fully autonomous and non-custodial alternative to traditional centralized exchange "legacy" features.
- **Future Vision**: Scaling to cross-chain digital estate execution and integration with on-chain legal DAOs.
